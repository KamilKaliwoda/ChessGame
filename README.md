# ChessGame

### My own project created in QtCreator via C++. The major objective was to create fully working application, where two players could play chess in a local environment. 

### Rules:
  1. White player every time has first move.
  2. Each type of counter has his own move set, identical as standard chess.
  3. The first player who knock down his opponent's king wins.

### In order to run application:
  1. Copy the repository.
  2. Open project via QtCreator.
  3. Run file main.cpp.
